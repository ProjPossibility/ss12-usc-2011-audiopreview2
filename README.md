"Audio Preview for Venues

Venues with assigned seating (i.e. concert halls) sometimes provide view simulations from a given seat to allow customers to determine which seat they’d like to buy a ticket for. However, for a person with a visual disability, the more useful information is how the venue sounds at that location.

Develop a system that models the acoustics of a given venue and lets users hear how a clip will sound from a given seat."
